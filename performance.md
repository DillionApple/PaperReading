### Dependency-Aware Network Adaptive Scheduling of Data-Intensive Parallel Jobs (TPDS 2019)

This paper utilizes the dependency graph (DAG) of big data tasks to raise the locality of the data and to reduce network cost of inter-rack traffics. One basic assumption of this paper is that inter-rack bandwidth is lower than intra-rack bandwidth.
